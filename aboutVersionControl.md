Create a new repository on your github account. Pay attention on the correct local path. Files in the directory will shown.

Changes in folders will be automatically sync between atom and github desktop.

// So, next go on seeing.

Notice that color represents meaning. Color green represents new added. Yellow means modify, and red is delete.

Every change should be commit before going on. After commiting, the color will change from green to gray, whether the file name or code lines.

Obviously, save before commit, and push after commit.

Each commit can change one or more files.

Notice that the changes haven't shown on web site. Maybe we haven't push.

By now, I have commit all of three new file added. As a result, their name turns from green into gray.

After I enter this sentence and save the file, the file name directly change into yellow, means modify. This happens both in Atom and github desktop.

Modify is define as some hierarchy. If a file is changed, its name turns yellow. And look in detail, how the changes of content represent.

Changes are based on lines. New line shows in green, and removed line shows in red. If a line is changed, old content shows in red, and new content shows in green. In other word, yellow color is not used inside file.

It's ok to change or edit files content on website end. What you have changed need a commit as well.
