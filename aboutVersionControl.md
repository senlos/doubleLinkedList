Create a new repository on your github account. Pay attention on the correct local path. Files in the directory will shown.

Changes in folders will be automatically sync between atom and github desktop.

So, next go on to see.

Notice that color represents meaning. Color green represents new added. Yellow means modify, and red is delete.

Every change should be commit before going on. After commiting, the color will change from green to gray, whether the file name or code lines.

Obviously, save before commit.

Each commit can change one or more files.

Notice that the changes haven't shown on web site. Maybe we haven't push.
